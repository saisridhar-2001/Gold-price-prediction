# Gold-price-prediction </br>
In this project,we are using machine learning libraries to get observe the data frame which is in form of CSV format.</br>
By using correlation and other algorithms we will predict the gold price of future.</br>
## Libraries Used:</br>
Numpy.</br>
pandas.</br>
matplotib</br>
seaborn.</br>
sklearn.</br>
## Work flow:</br>
Gold price data frame which consist of gold prices from last Decade,</br>
Data pre-processing,</br>
Data Analysis,</br>
Train test split,</br>
Random forest regressor,</br>
evalution</br>
## Conclusion:
In this project , we used to train a machine learning model to predict the the prize</br>
of Gold by providing a  large amount of Data frame </br>
Here, we taken Data frame of Several prizes of metals along with olong Gold & by using Correlation</br>
We Compare the Two Data's & by using ML Libraries like matplot lib we used to obtain a prediction with the Actual value</br>
